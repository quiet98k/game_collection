# Python Game Collection

Welcome to the Python Game Collection! This repository hosts a series of classic games implemented entirely in Python. Perfect for those looking to enjoy some nostalgic gameplay or developers interested in exploring game development with Python.

## Project Overview

This collection is dedicated to bringing classic games to life using Python.

## Games Included

### Sudoku
Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle where players fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 grids contain all the digits from 1 to 9.
- **Code File**: [Sudoku.py](./Sudoku.py)

### Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple yet engaging game where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid, with the goal of placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal pattern.
- **Code File**: [Tic_Tac_Toe.py](./Tic_Tac_Toe.py)

## Installation and Setup

Before running the games, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quiet98k/game_collection.git
```
Navigate to the game directory you wish to play, for example:
```bash
cd game_collection
```
## Usage

To play the games in this collection, you will run the `main.py` script, which is the central entry point for all games.

Navigate to the root directory of the game collection, and then execute `main.py` using Python from your command line:

```bash
cd game_collection  # Change directory to your cloned repository
python main.py
```
